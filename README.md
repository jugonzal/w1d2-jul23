Chronal Calibration Challenge

## What we are doing

This is our attempt to solve the *Day 1* challenge:

- define global variables for the frequency
- get all the frequencies
- put them in an array
  - or something else? 
- initialize the global sum to zero
- iterate through all frequencies
  - sum up the numbers _(consider using function)_
  - store sum in our global variable
